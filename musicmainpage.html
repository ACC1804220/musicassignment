		<h1><center> A Story of the Piano<br>
		<small use class="origin">It's Origin</small></center></h1>
		<p use class="introduction">Instruments are usually divided into three categories: string, wind and purcussion. It is based on how they produce sounds. The piano's ancestry can be traced back through various instruments, such as the clavichord, harpsichord, and dulcimer. But if it were traced back even further, one would find that the piano is a descendant of the monochord, which is surprisingly a string instrument! </p>

		<h2><center>The Piano Has the Same Mechanism as the Dulcimer</center></h2><hr use class="introduction"></hr>
		<div use class="photobox"><left><img src="dulcimer.png" alt=dulcimer height="200"width="300" use class ="photobox13"></left></div>
		<div use class="textbox13"><right><p use class="paragraph">The classification of a piano is said to be akin to that of a dulcimer’s. It’s unique duality stems from its method of operation. On one hand, it can be happily grouped in the house of string instruments as the sounds it produces is due to the vibration of taut wires, on another hand the family of percussion instruments are also eager to accept the piano as one of their kind as the piano requires the striking of a hammer on a string in order to bring about the string’s vibration. <br><br>
		Hailing from the sandy dunes of the Middle East, the dulcimer has made its way across the continent and spread to Europe around the 11th century. Being a predecessor of the piano, it has a much simpler design which consists of a resonating box with strings pulled taut across the top of it. Despite its simplicity, it still operates much the same way as a piano does; with a tiny hammer associated with each string that strikes the string and generates sound.

		<h2><center>The Clavichord, a Big Step Towards the Piano</center></h2><hr use class="introduction"></hr>
		<div use class="photobox"><left><img src="clavichord.png" alt=clavichord height="200"width="300" use class ="photobox24"></left></div>
		<div use class="textbox24"><right><p use class="paragraph">Much effort is out into the precise classification of piano, but the results yielded only proves it all the more complicated as to which exact faction it belongs to. With that being said, the family of keyboard instruments are perfectly eligible to claim the piano under its wing. This has to be proven by the turnings of the history of keyboard instruments, which proclaims the organ as its earliest ancestor. The organ is a marvelous instrument which has a curious mechanism of making sound by sending bursts of air through stiff pipes. Later on, it was improved and enhanced by skilled craftsmen to form the clavichord.<br><br>
		The birth of the clavichord dates back to the 14th century where a surge in its popularity could be observed during the Renaissance era. It operates solely by pressing keys, which would cause a brass rod to strike a string and produce vibrations. Each clavichord has a range of keys that when pressed, emits sound over a satisfying range of 4 to 5 octaves. Needless to say, it is an even closer ancestor of the piano as one of the main features of a piano are its zebra-like black and white keys.

		<h2><center>The Piano Looks Like a Harpsichord</center></h2><hr use class="introduction"></hr>
		<div use class="photobox"><left><img src="harpsichord.png" alt=harpsichord height="200"width="300" use class ="photobox13"></left></div>
		<div use class="textbox13"><right><p use class="paragraph">Created in Italy in around 1500, the harpsichord later spread to France, Germany, Flanders, and Great Britain. When a key is pressed, a plectrum attached to a long strip of wood called a jack plucks the string to make music.<br><br>
		This system of strings and soundboard, and the overall structure of the instrument resemble those that can be found in a piano.

		<h2><center>Cristofori, Creator of the First Piano</center></h2><hr use class="introduction"></hr>
		<div use class="photobox"><left><img src="firstpiano.png" alt=firstpiano height="200"width="300" use class ="photobox24"></left></div>
		<div use class="textbox24"><right><p use class="paragraph">Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655-1731) of Italy is said to be the father of all modern pianos.<br><br>
		It is said that dissatisfaction yields demand, and demand prompts creation. So was it in the case of the piano’s creation. Cristofori was less than delighted about the lack of control musicians had over the volume of the harpsichord. He was thus credited for switching the direct plucking mechanism with a hammer instead which gave rise to one of the earliest pianos. This took place around 1700.<br><br>
		The new instrument as initially named as “clavicembalo col piano e forte” which directly translates to “a harpsichord that can play both soft and loud notes”. Over the centuries it was gradually shortened to the familiar term “piano”.
